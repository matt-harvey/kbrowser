# What is this?

I'm hacking around with a vanilla PHP web app intended only for running locally, for
exploring a Kubernetes cluster.

I made this on a whim and it's intended for use only by me. Don't use it.

# Prerequisites

* PHP 8.2+
* `kubectl` installed locally
* `kubens` and `kubectx` installed locally in the form of `krew` plugins:
  * `kubect ns` is assumed to work
  * `kubectl ctx` is assumed to work
