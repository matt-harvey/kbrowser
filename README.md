# What is this?

I'm hacking around with a vanilla PHP web app intended only for running locally, for
exploring a Kubernetes cluster.

I made this on a whim for my own use. Don&rsquo;t hold me accountable for it!

# Prerequisites

* PHP 8.2+
* `kubectl` installed locally

# Run it

Run `bin/serve.sh` from the project root, and browse to http://localhost:5858.
